How to handle rexmission if the size of the xmit buffer is 15000 bytes. Should we just assume that rexmit is rare and that it will incur some greater penalty (fetching from over DMA). Needs to be larger then RTTbytes?

Rpc_buffer needs to consider the left shift

Virtualization?

RPC should be larger than 2^14. LIFO increases risk of old packet being dislodged. Could also tag the RPC ids somehow.

If the message is short < 1000 bytes, it should bypass DMA (and maybe the SRPT system)

The streams will need to be deeper in certain places? Or will the writes just stall and it will be fine?

Can pipelining be properly performed with blocking reads and writes? It may only allow for a single read to be placed before a result is read. This would create large latency stalls.
