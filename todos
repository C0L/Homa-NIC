How to handle rexmission if the size of the xmit buffer is 15000 bytes. Should we just assume that rexmit is rare and that it will incur some greater penalty (fetching from over DMA). Needs to be larger then RTTbytes?

Rpc_buffer needs to consider the left shift

Virtualization?

RPC should be larger than 2^14. LIFO increases risk of old packet being dislodged. Could also tag the RPC ids somehow.

High level figure showing pipeline and fifo interfaces to all of the cores

If the message is short < 1000 bytes, it should bypass DMA (and maybe the SRPT system)

The streams will need to be deeper in certain places? Or will the writes just stall and it will be fine?

Can pipelining be properly performed with blocking reads and writes? It may only allow for a single read to be placed before a result is read. This would create large latency stalls.

Simpler hash function?

Is a peer map even really needed?

Where to place unscheduled bytes in DMA space?

How does ethernet mac subsytem handle the empty chunks in the last packet chunk? The tlast of the AXI Stream is used to assert the completition of an ethernet frame.
    - Is this why the AXI Stream runs at 322 MHz??

Timer core needs to be looped in

Grant packets need to feed to SRPT queue

ACKs need to be sent

Where do unscheduled data bytes go? Where should we place data in DMA that we did not request?
